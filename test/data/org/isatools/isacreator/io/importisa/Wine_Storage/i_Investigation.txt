Study Title	"Metabolic changes during wine storage"
Study Description	"Storage conditions and duration have a great influence on wine quality and nutritional value. Optimum temperature and humidity conditions may improve wine quality through aging while a wrong storage has a negative result. In order to evaluate the global effects of storage on wine composition, 20 red wines were stored under two conditions (optimum and domestic) for a period of 24 months and sampled every 6 months. The untargeted LC-MS analysis of the samples reveals various putative metabolites markers for the type and the length of the conservation (i.e. pigments, flavanols, pantothenic acid, etc)."

Study Protocol Description	"During the vintage 2009 twenty Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sangiovese grape samples from different areas of Montalcino (Tuscany - Italy) were collected, in order to cover the whole area of production of Brunello di Montalcino. From each selected vineyard, a total of ca. 80 kg of grapes was sampled in 20 kg boxes and sent in a refrigerated transport (4 °C) to the experimental winery at the Edmund Mach Foundation (Trentino - Italy) on the same day. The grapes from each zone were vinified separately and after the malolactic fermentation (March 2010) the young wine samples were filtered and bottled in 375 mL dark glass bottles (~20 bottles from each wine). 
Two bottles from each wine was stored at 4 oC (references). The rest of the bottles from each wine were divided in two and stored in two different conditions: (i) One set was stored so to mimic the typical house/domestic wine conservation, with variable conditions during the year, in a room with no light but without control of the temperature or humidity (House) and (ii) The other set was stored in a cellar where the temperature (15-17 oC) and the humidity (~70%) was controlled, stable and optimum for red wine conservation (Cellar). Every 6 months four bottle from each wine (two from the house and two from the cellar conservation) was sampled and brought at 4 oC. 
The final storage length was 24 months after the time zero which was bottling date. All samples were analyzed together in the end of the experiment. 
"	""	"A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. The UPLC conditions were developed based in an in house previous published method (Arapitsas, Scholz, et al., 2012) and small changes were made in order to have a shorter chromatographic run and smaller back pressures. All samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 µm 2.1 x 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) protected with an Acquity UPLC® BEH HSS T3 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 oC and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.28 mL/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 0.1% v/v was used as additive in both eluents. The multistep linear gradient used was as follows: 0-1 min, 100% A isocratic; 1-3 min, 100-90 % A linear; 3-18 min, 90-60 % A linear; 18-21 min, 60-0 % A linear; 21-25.5 min, 0 % A isocratic; 25.5-25.6 min, 0-100 % A linear; 25.6-28 min 100% isocratic. Injection volume was 10 µL, unless otherwise stated, and the samples were kept at 4 ºC throughout the analysis."	"A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. Mass spectrometric data were collected by different runs in positive and negative ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan and 2.5 kV for negative scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3V, source temperature 150 ºC, desolvation temperature 500 ºC, desolvation gas flow 1000 L/h and nebulizer gas 50 L/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8) by controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg/L, m/z 556.2771 for positive and 554.2620 for negative ion mode) at 0.1 mL/min. "	"For the quality control of the analysis and the number of features determination the raw data was converted to CDF (Waters Databridge) format and then processed using XCMS for feature extraction, grouping and alignment. For peak picking, the matched Filter algorithm was used with a peak width estimate of 20 s. The signal to noise parameter was set to S/N = 6. Data extraction parameters were selected on the basis of the characteristics of chromatographic and mass spectrometric performance. "	"Peak annotation was performed manually by comparing retention times and mass spectra (mass difference less than 10 ppm and two ions) to those of the standard, when available. Tentative identification of the chromatographic peaks, without a standard, was made by using spectral features (mass difference less than 10 ppm of theoretical value at least one indicative fragment and the isotopic pattern), and literature information about chromatographic properties and mass spectra records from external database like HMDB, Kegg and MassBank and an internal database for the wine metabolome based in bibliography. "	"The UPLC-QTOF MS untargeted analyses were preformed within two months after the end of the experimental design and during this period wines were maintained at 4 oC so to block or slow down all possible reactions. Wines were uncorked under nitrogen atmosphere and an aliquot was transferred in a 15 mL amber vial (filled to its capacity). Then, always under nitrogen atmosphere, 3 quality control (QC) pool samples were prepared: (i) one pool sample by using 0.5 mL of each wine (QC), (ii) one pool sample by using 0.5 mL of each House conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCH) and, (iii) one pool sample by using 0.5 mL of each Cellar conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCC). 
For the dilution test, the QC sample was diluted 1:1 and 1:2 with Milli-Q water. Following the dilution experiment results, 1 mL of each wine was diluted with 1 mL Milli-Q water (1:1 dilution) and then 20 μL of the internal standard mix was added. Finally every sample/QC was filtrated with 0.2 μm PTFE filters into a 2 mL autosampler amber vial (MS certificated) prior the LC/MS analysis.  The internal standard mix was 10 mg 3-indol proprionic acid and 17 mg 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid in 10 mL of MeOH:OH (1:1). For the blank the same procedure was followed but instead of wine 1 mL of Milli-Q water was used. The standard mix (STDMIX) was a mixture of trans-piceid (20 ppm), caffeic acid (50 ppm), catechin (5 ppm), malvidin 3-glucoside (5 ppm), quercetin 3-rutinoside (6 ppm), adenosine 2-monophosphate (45 ppm), malic acid (48 ppm), nicotinic acid (46 ppm), phenylalanine (42 ppm), and glucose (45 ppm) in MeOH:H2O (70:30). 
"	"This experiment included all 40 wines (20 house + 20 cellar) of the final point (24 months), QCH, QCC, blank and STDMIX. The in-batch order of all samples analysed in this study was randomized by using the http://www.random.org/sequences/ site. This sample set was analyzed both in ESI + and ESI- mode. In the beginning of every batch first one blank, then one STDMIX and after four QCs (2 QCH and 2 QCC) were injected. After this system equilibration two QC (one QCH and one QCC) was injected every six samples. The order of the two QCs were inverted every six samples. Finally in the end of every batch one blank and one standard mix were injected."	"-- XCMS settings --

"	"The statistical analysis of the aligned and normalized data was made by multivariate statistical analysis using EZInfo SIMCA-P version 12.0.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). Partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to visualize discrimination between the various theses and find features contributing to these discriminations, based in t-test with Mann-Whitney U-test and the S-plot.    "	"For this sample set, five wines out from the twenty were randomly selected and their sample of the reference time point (2 months), the 6 months (both house and cellar), the 12 months (both house and cellar), the 18 months (both house and cellar) and the 24 months (both house and cellar) were all included. So, the the final sample set included the 45 wines, the QC, the blank and the STDMIX. Also this sample set was analyzed both in ESI + and ESI- mode. Again in the beginning of every batch first one blank, then one STDMIX and after four QCs were injected. After this system equilibration one QC was injected every six samples and in the end of every batch one blank and one standard mix were injected. "	"Sample preparation for the measurement of wine pigments was performed according to Arapitsas et al. (J. Agric Food Chem, 2012). Briefly, 25 mL of wine diluted 4 times with H2O, were applied to a C18-SPE cartridge (1 g, Waters), previously activated with MeOH (5 mL) and H2O (10 mL). The cartridge was washed with 6 mL of 0.3% aqueous HClO4 and then eluted with 10 mL of MeOH into a 100 mL flask. The elute was evaporated under reduced pressure at 30 oC, reconstituted in 1 mL of MeOH/H2O (1/1), filtered through 0.22 µm PTFE filters into a 2 mL autosampler amber MS certificated vial (Waters) and injected. "	"Wines were uncorked under nitrogen atmosphere, 5 mL were transferred in a 7 mL amber vial and 50 µL of IS were added (10mg/mL of o-coumaric acid). Then, always under nitrogen atmosphere,  an aliquot (~1.5 mL) of was filtered through 0.22 µm PTFE filters into a 2 mL autosampler amber MS certificated vial (Waters) and injected."	"the analysis of the samples studied was performed with an ACQUITY Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatographic System (Waters, MA, USA) coupled to a Xevo TQ MS System (Waters, UK) operating under MassLynx™ XS Software. All samples were analysed on a reverse phase (RP) Acquity UPLC® BEH C18 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 150 mm column (Waters), protected with an Acquity UPLC® BEH C18 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 60 oC and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 5% v/v was used as additive in both eluents. The multistep linear gradient used was as follows: from 95 to 60% of A for the first 4 min, 60 to 45% A from 4 to 9 min, 45 to 5% A from 9 to 11 min, and an isocratic hold for 3 min in order to clean the column. The equilibration time was 4 min and the injection volume was 2 µL. All the samples were analysed in triplicate. The analyses were performed six months after the end of the experimental design and in between all wines were maintained at 4 oC. "	"The column eluent was directed to the mass spectrometer and analyte detection was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using the MS/MS transitions shown in Arapitsas et al. (Arapitsas, Perenzoni, et al., 2012) Electrospray positive ionization mode (ESI) was applied for all compounds with the parameters in the source set as follows: capillary voltage at 0.5 kV, block and desolvation temperatures at 150 and 500 oC respectively. Desolvation gas flow was 1000 L/Hr and cone gas flow 20 L/Hr. LM resolutions were 2.55 and 2.80 for analyzer 1 and 2 respectively, while HM resolutions were 14.90 and 15.00 LM for analyzer 1 and 2 respectively. Ion energy for analyzer 2 was 1.0. The cone voltage, collision energy, MS/MS transition, the data processing and the quantification was performed as described in the paper of Arapitsas et al (Arapitsas et al J Agric Food Chem, 2012). "	"For the analysis of the non-anthocyanic phenols, the method described by Vrhovsek et al. was used with slight modifications (Vrhovsek et al. J Agric Food Chem, 2012). Briefly, the analysis of the samples studied was performed with an ACQUITY Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatographic System (Waters, MA, USA) coupled to a Xevo TQ MS System (Waters, UK) operating under MassLynx™ XS Software. All samples were analysed on a reverse phase (RP) Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 150 mm column (Waters), protected with an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 oC and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 0.1% v/v was used as additive in both eluents. The multistep linear gradient used was as follows: from 95 to 80% of A for the first 3 min, isocratic 80% for 1.3 min, 80 to 55% A from 4.3 to 9 min, 55 to 0% A from 9 to 11 min, and an isocratic hold for 2 min in order to clean the column. The equilibration time was 4 min and the injection volume was 10 µL. All the samples were analysed in triplicate. The analyses were performed 10 months after the end of the experimental design and in between all wines were maintained at 4 oC."
